- support for 1.3.x (experimental,to be tested by concerned users, avoid to call catalog_eav_attribute table)
- support for windows installs (idem, fixes include_path modifications using PATH_SEPARATOR)
- values on the second page (plugin values for import) are now saved and restored , stored in "conf" directory
- no more need to add many "stores" to match the many websites, magmi will take care of this , so only "admin" store is needed when websites column is present
- new plugin "Default values", that enable to set store,websites,type & attribute set if not present in csv, this will enable importing values from csv with only sku+data values . if the one of the "default values plugin" column is present in csv, the csv value is taken, if not, the default value is taken.
- added some robustness , if a website as no store attached, magmi will not try to assign values for the missing store instead of issuing "No [type] attribute set for sku XXX"
- new parameter model, see website documentation "command line".
- some basic info on plugins added on 2nd page
- Indexer Plugin v1.0.1 - used realpath to call magento indexer
- moved sample plugins from scanned plugins directory to "tests/plugin" directory
- cli interface fixed, should work ok now.
